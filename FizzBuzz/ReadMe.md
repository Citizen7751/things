# Scallable FizzBuzz Challenge

I saw a great and fairy scallable way to implement the famous Fizzbuzz game, so I decided to hop on the train myself as well.

### Compile with GCC

Windows
```
g++ -o FizzBuzz.exe FizzBuzz.cpp -s -O3
```

Linux
```
g++ -o FizzBuzz FizzBuzz.cpp -s -O3
```

(Both programs are can be compiled with ```g++```, this is why I showed only the C++ compile command.)
